# Cricket-Statistics

I have used 8 different datasets with different cricket statistics to work on this project.

This project uses the following libraries:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. scikit learn
5. seaborn

It also uses the linear regression model for model training and calculates MSE , MAE and R2 score.
